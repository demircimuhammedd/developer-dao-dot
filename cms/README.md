## Development

### Prerequisites

create `.env` from `.env.example` and remove `JWT_SECRET` such as it would be generated and added to `.env` file by Strapi

### `develop`

Start your Strapi application with autoReload enabled. [Learn more](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/cli/CLI.html#strapi-develop)

```
yarn develop
```

### `seed`

By default, on the first application _DEVELOPMENT_ start(with `yarn develop`), **seed data** would be generated. In case you need to re-create it, run

```
yarn seed
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This will **clear all data** from all available collections
 
> ‚ö†Ô∏è If something happens during seeding and data starts to grow rapidly - **clear User collection** manually

#### How it works?

Strapi runs **bootstrap** function from `/src/index.js` [every time on server start](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/configurations/optional/functions.html#bootstrap).

On the initial run, we check if the current mode is _development_ to run `generateSeedData` function. Only if we previously haven't run seeding - we run it.

When manual seeding happens with `FORCE_APP_BOOTSTRAP_ONLY` in _development_ mode, we run `strapi start` and exit right after **bootstrap** is finished.
In this case, we could have our main app running and not worry about the "port is used" error.

There are default values of how much data we want to generate - feel free to increase or make them 0.
```
DEV_SEED_DATA_PROJECTS=8
DEV_SEED_DATA_CONTRIBUTORS=15
DEV_SEED_DATA_PARTNERS=5
```

### `start`

Start your Strapi application with autoReload disabled. [Learn more](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/cli/CLI.html#strapi-start)

```
yarn start
```

### `build`

Build your admin panel. [Learn more](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/cli/CLI.html#strapi-build)

```
yarn build
```
