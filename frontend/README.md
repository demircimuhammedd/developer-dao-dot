## What is a DAO

DAO stands for Decentalized autonomous organisation. That is a group of people with shared goals/mission that are governed by an agreed set of rules coded into a smart contract(s) on a blockchain.

If you want to learn more about DAOs, check out Cooper Turley's blog at https://alias.co/coopahtroopa/essays, mainly "The Rise of Micro-Economies"

## What is DeveloperDAO

The project was started as an experiment by [Nader Dabit](https://twitter.com/dabit3) to see what can be achieved when we bring together talented and likeminded people who are interested in learning about, and building on, Web3.

As stated on : "Developers around the world are tired of working and contributing their time and effort to enrich the top 1%. Join the movement that is community owned, building the future from the bottom up."

## How do I join?

The DAO operates inside our [discord sever](https://twitter.com/dabit3). To gain access to this server you need to own a [Devs for Revolution](https://opensea.io/collection/devs-for-revolution) NFT. You can find the contract for purchasing one [here](https://etherscan.io/token/0x25ed58c027921e14d86380ea2646e3a1b5c55a8b) and a good how to article on how to purchase one from @jkup, [here](https://jonkuperman.com/how-to-join-developer-dao/ ). 

Whilst there is no charge for the NFT you will have to pay a "gas fee" for the Ethereum Blockchain network in order to purchase the NFT. This fee can range wildy from about $40 up to and over $400 at peak times. If the fee is high you may want to wait and come back later. 

That said, there is a limited supply of NFT's that can be created.

If you get stuck please reach out on our [discord](https://discord.gg/ZHZup79J) and we'd be happy to help.

## What is this repo?

This is the code for the [public DeveloperDAO site](https://developerdao.com/).

At the moment it allows members to view their genesis NFT by entering in its ID. As the community takes shape we will decide what this website becomes and build it as a collective.
